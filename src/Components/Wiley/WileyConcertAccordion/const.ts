    title: "Prologue Circus",
    composer: "Shuhei Tamura",
    publisher: "Brain Co., Ltd.",
    year: "2023",
    grade: "4",
    time: "4:00",
    details: `A first piece, Prologue One, was based on the concept of fanfares and pops, while a second, Prologue Majestia, used the concept of chorales and marches, but for this third piece, the idea of a 'circus march' was proposed.

The title is derived from the Latin "circus", meaning "circle", but the name here is a variation on that, meaning "a work that creates a spectacle of fun".

We hope you will find it useful not on openly as a concert opener, but also as repertoire for introducing various sections.`,

    title: "S'vivon",
    composer: "Laura Estes",
    publisher: "Excelcia Music Publishing",
    year: "2021",
    grade: "1",
    time: "3:30",
    details: `Who doesn't like a good game of Dreidel on Chanukah?

Loved by children all over the world, a dreidel is a 4-sided spinning top. Known in the Hebrew language as a "s'vivon," each side features a different Hebrew letter: Nun, Gimmel, Hey, and Shin, which each represent the first letter of the words: Nes Gadol Hayah Sham - "A Great Miracle Happened There." One of my favorite Chanukah songs is "S'vivon, sov, sov, sov," which translates to "Dreidel, spin, spin, spin." With an upbeat tempo, toes will be tapping as students become familiar with this infectiously happy melody that occurs in a minor key.

S'vivon! is the perfect introduction to the key of F minor for young band students-the note Concert E is the only accidental, and is used sparingly. With a catchy melody and an engaging blend of syncopation throughout, students will feel an air of festivity while rehearsing S'vivon!. The fun really begins halfway through the music when most everybody gets to be a percussionist - listen for 2 different hand-clap rhythms occurring simultaneously! Especially loved will be the loud shout of "Savi" in the final measure.

Written as a concert piece that is coincidentally associated with Chanukah, this arrangement of S'vivon! brings the unmistakable joy of spinning dreidels to everyone and creates an exhilarating learning environment at any time of year.`,

    title: "Encanto",
    composer: "Robert W. Smith",
    publisher: "Hal Leonard, LLC",
    year: "1989",
    grade: "3",
    time: "5:00",
    details: `Robert W. Smith was a prolific composer of band music in the United States. With over 600 published works to his name, he is one of the most played band composers in public school band rooms across the nation. Smith passed away unexpectedly in September of 2023 from complications following cardiac surgery. Encanto (Spanish for “charm”) is one of his most played compositions. It opens with a brass fanfare and evolves into an infectious rhythmic statement. The opening fanfare reappears at the end of the piece and leads decisively to a powerful ending.`,

    title: "Country Gardens",
    composer: "Percy Aldridge Grainger/John Philip Sousa/Brion/Schissel",
    publisher: "Willow Blossom Music / C.L. Barnhouse Company",
    year: "1999",
    grade: "4",
    time: "2:00",
    details: `The charismatic, quirky, brilliant character of Percy Grainger is not likely to be recreated. A genius by any measure, Grainger was a piano virtuoso, a major force in the collection and preservation of folk songs, and a visionary composer of considerable gifts.

In 1918, Grainger wrote to Cecil Sharp about a new folk song setting he had prepared. During one of his Liberty Loan concerts, Percy had improvised on one of Sharp’s Morris dance tunes called Country Gardens - a Handkerchief Dance. Percy’s version of Country Gardens proved so popular that he decided to commit it to paper, and presented it as a birthday gift to his mother in 1918. As with his other folk song settings, it was “lovingly and reverently dedicated to the memory of Edvard Grieg.”

John Philip Sousa admired Grainger’s compositions and programmed them regularly. Sousa knew a good tune when he heard it, and decided to arrange and feature Country Gardens in concerts with his own band.

    title: "A Life Worth Living",
    composer: "Brian Balmages",
    publisher: "MakeMusic Publications",
    year: "2023",
    grade: "3",
    time: "5:00",
    details: `Mental health has rightfully become an important part of conversations throughout the world and, very slowly, societies are starting to remove the stigma associated with it. When Taylor Williamson (director of bands at Wiley Middle School in Leander, Texas) approached me about writing a piece for their honor band performance at TMEA, he was very clear about the reasons behind the commission. His brother-in-law,  Justin, had been a high school star athlete and was liked by everyone. He brought a special light into the world, had a wonderful wife and two children. What people did not know was that Justin had been going through a dark journey over many years, struggling with alcoholism and mental illness. Despite being  surrounded by family trying to help him and entering several rehab facilities, Justin constantly feared that he was a burden to everyone around him. Justin ultimately succumbed to his mental illness in November 2021.

In writing this piece, I wanted to accomplish several things. First, I wanted to help Justin’s family process their loss and bring something beautiful into the world to honor him and the rest of their family. I also  wanted this to be a piece that lets everyone know their life is worth living, that they do matter, and that every single person can make an impact. But I also wanted to take it a step further. My family and I love to vacation in Stone Harbor, a beautiful beach on the New Jersey Shore. As you leave the island, there is some artwork on the side of a building that reminds us to “Live a Life You’d Relive.” This is how the title A Life Worth Living came to be. 

This piece is a strong reminder to all of us that we should live our best and fullest lives as much as possible. It is a reminder to students that we don’t take popularity with us when we leave this world, nor do we take possessions. Our lives can be defined by the impact we make on those around us, by how we choose to bring beauty into the world, by how we care for others in need, and by the relationships we cultivate,  
the people we inspire, and how we lift up those who may not be able to lift themselves up. A life worth living,  or reliving, is the most beautiful thing we can strive for and truly helps recenter our priorities.

As the music starts, it is very transparent and ethereal with moments of brightness throughout. What follows is complicated, mildly dissonant, but still an “attempt” at being positive. Nonetheless, it feels like a struggle back and forth between darkness and light until the music becomes unmistakably beautiful,  leading into the first statement of the main theme (which takes over 2 minutes to arrive). Tonal centers shift as the music develops, and a massive amount of tension is finally released in an amazing moment of strength and clarity. The music then retreats as it becomes more contemplative, ending with a final spark of sound that seems to last forever.`,

    title: "Rising From The Earth",
    composer: "Adrian Sims",
    publisher: "Manuscript",
    grade: "3",
    time: "3:30",
    details: `Imagine witnessing the formation of Earth’s largest natural superstructures. This music is inspired by massive rocks rising from the ground to create the tallest mountains on Earth and the breathtaking terrain that exists today.

The sounds of rocks colliding, represented by the first notes, set the piece in motion. Following this, the music calms for a moment as a solo horn introduces the main theme. As surrounding chords continue to build tension, the tempo hastens as more powerful formations take place. Volcanic eruptions and impulsive outbursts occur throughout, often echoed by softer passages that lead us right back to moments of high intensity.

After numerous passages that rise and fall, we finally arrive at a full statement of the melody that grooves and dances as we see what such destructive chaos has created: massive mountains and an incredible horizon to gaze upon.`,

    title: "Swahili Folk Hymn",
    composer: "Kevin Mixon",
    publisher: "Belwin Music",
    year: "2008",
    grade: "1",
    time: "2:50",
    conductor: "Cristina Davidson",
    details: `There are approximately one-half million Swahili people inhabiting the eastern coastal regions of Africa in Somalia, Kenya and Tanzania. Though ancestry and language are considered to be largely descendants of the Bantu World in sub-Saharan Africa, Swahili culture also has strong affiliation with Arabic culture and Islam, as well as Asian and European influences. 

The original lyrics of the song used in this arrangement are sacred: "Bwana Awabiriki, Ukimcha Bwana" ("May God grant you a blessing, Revere the Lord"). However, the song's popularity has be-come widespread and secularized lyrics such as "Thanks to our teachers" or "Peace to all nations" are often used in addition to the original.`,

    year: "2023",
    grade: "2",
    time: "3:00",
    conductor: "Rachel Johnstone",
    details: `This composition is a peace song, and its message is very simple. I wanted to create something for this planet where we could live in a peaceful mind. Our "terra" should be beautiful with mindful people and thoughts. Play with your kind feelings to reach the ears of the listeners. 

Keep the tone of each phrase legato. Some of these phrases are rather long. If the players need to take a breath, the melodies should still be stable with espressivo playing.`,

    title: "Under the Ice",
    composer: "Tyler S. Grant",
    publisher: "Tyler S. Grant",
    year: "2024",
    grade: "2",
    time: "4:00",
    details: `Known for its incredibly vast size, Lake Michigan has been rumored to be the home of mysterious and undefined mythical creatures. Many have reported their haunting encounters which has led to illustrations and thrilling theories of what lurks beneath the surface. This folklore, paired with Lake Michigan’s history of frozen ice patches, served as the inspiration for Under the Ice. 

    The opening aims to evoke a sense of mystery and anticipation, while subtle harmonies and eerie textures set the scene for an impending encounter. Without warning, the ice gives way to the creature’s emergence. From there, the music erupts into a frantic chase sequence with relentless rhythms based on the opening’s original theme. 

    The remainder of the work propels the listener forward in a desperate attempt to evade the jaws of the mysterious beast.
    
    Under the Ice was commissioned by and dedicated to the Mequon-Thiensville Middle School Symphonic Band (WI) and their director, Brad Feigles, Director.`,

    title: "Snowscape",
    composer: "Randall Standridge",
    publisher: "Randall Standridge Music, LLC",
    year: "2024",
    grade: "2",
    time: "3:00",
    details: `From Randall Standridge: As a child, I loved the snow. As an adult, nothing has changed. This is mainly due to the fact that I live in eastern Arkansas, where we rarely see such weather. We tend to get ice, frost, and freezing rain…but only occasionally snow. Every time I see snowflakes in the forecast, I turn into a kid again. I begin planning all of the things I want to build, all of the photos I want to take outdoors, the hot cocoa, the roaring fire in the fireplace… I mean, I’m not even above building a blanket fort at this age. I also get the ingredients to make “snow cream” (ask me for the recipe sometime). 

    The point is that there is just something magical about snow. This work attempts to i lustrate the feeling of waking up on a cold winter’s day and looking out into the snow-covered landscape. Trees peek from beneath blankets of white, and icicles dangle from every surface. The snow continues to fall, and the snowflakes, snowdrifts, and ice reflect light, creating a dazzling and merry scene. Children can be seen playing and building snowmen. Grabbing your coat and mittens, you run outside into the bracing cold to join them, laughing all the way. Peace, Love, and Music 

    Snowscape was written in celebration of the 20th Anniversary of the Kansas John Philip Sousa Middle Level Honor Band, and commissioned by the group as well.`,
