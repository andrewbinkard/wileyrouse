    title: "Commando March",
    composer: "Samuel Barber/R. Anderson Collinsworth",
    publisher: "G. Schirmer/Hal Leonard",
    year: "2009",
    grade: "4",
    time: "3:34",
    details: `When famed composer Samuel Barber joined the United States Army in 1942, he quickly went to work writing music for the war effort.  Though not officially commissioned to do so by the US government, Barber’s first work after his military induction was Commando March, and it was premiered by the Army Air Forces Technical Command Training Band in early 1943.
    
    Commando March enjoyed immediate success as the Goldman Band played the work throughout the summer of 1943, leading to a request by Serge Koussevitzky for Barber to adapt it for orchestra.  The orchestral adaptation received its premiere with the Boston Symphony under the baton of Koussevitzky in October of 1943. The rapid pace of composition, premiere, achieving popular success and orchestral adaptation in the same calendar year can be attributed to Barber’s high status as one of the most widely-accepted American composers of his time.
    
    Barber’s music gathered broad acclaim not just among his American colleagues, but throughout Europe as well, solidifying him as one of the titans of twentieth-century American music.  Commando March endures as a cornerstone work for wind band, standing as the singular, yet beloved contribution to the band genre from a two-time Pulitzer Prize winning icon of American music.

    title: "Ye Banks and Braes O' Bonnie Doon",
    composer: "Percy Aldridge Grainger",
    publisher: "G. Schirmer/Hal Leonard",
    year: "1936",
    grade: "3",
    time: "2:55",
    details: `Grainger’s arrangement of the Scottish song The Caledonian Hunt’s Delight became Ye Banks and Braes O Bonnie Doon. The river Doon flows gracefully between the Loch Doon and the Firth of Clyde in Stirlingshire, Scotland. It was inspired by Robert Burns poem, The Banks of Doon, written in 1783. 

    Oh, banks and hills of lovely Doon,
    How can you bloom so fresh and fair;
    How can you chant, diminutive birds,
    When I'm so weary, full of care!
    You'll break my heart, small warblers,
    Flittering through the flowering thorn:
    Reminding me of long-lost joys,
    Departed―never to return!

    I've often wandered lovely Doon,
    To see the rose and woodbine twine;
    And as the lark sang of its love,
    Just as fondly, I sang of mine.
    Then gaily-hearted I plucked a rose,
    So fragrant upon its thorny tree;
    And my false lover stole my rose,
    But, ah!, he left the thorn in me.

    (modern English translation by Michael R. Burch)

    The piece was originally scored in 1903 for a chorus of women’s unison voices, accompanied by men’s voices, whistlers, and harmonium or organ at will. This was one of Grainger’s earliest folk-music arrangements, and it was dedicated to his dear friend Sigurd Fornander. The setting for band was completed in 1932 (British Folk-Music Setting Nt. 31) and could be combined with the original choral arrangement.

    composer: "John Mackey",
    publisher: "Osti Music",
    year: "2024",
    grade: "5",
    time: "4:40",
    details: `Fission is an exhilarating and dynamic work and is the concert band adaptation of Mackey’s contribution to Carolina Crown Drum and Bugle Corps 2024 show, “Promethean.” Known for his energetic and innovative compositions, Mackey has once again captured the imagination of performers and audiences alike with this electrifying work.

The piece draws its inspiration from the concept of nuclear fission, where the nucleus of an atom splits into smaller parts, releasing a significant amount of energy. This scientific process serves as a powerful metaphor for the explosive energy and rapid changes that characterize the piece. Listeners will experience a musical journey that mirrors the intense energy release and transformative nature of fission.

Fission received its original premiere at the 2024 Texas Bandmasters Association Convention.`,

    title: "Flight of the Ravens",
    composer: "Carol Brittin Chambers",
    publisher: "Aspenwood Music; The Music of Carol Brittin Chambers",
    year: "2023",
    grade: "3",
    time: "3:43",
    details: `Flight of the Ravens was commissioned by the Texas Lutheran University School of Music in 2023, dedicated with love and gratitude to Professor Beth Bronk for her work as Director of Bands at TLU, her thoughtful mentorship of students, and her friendship.

    Quite a lot of mythology exists surrounding the raven, arguably one of the most intelligent birds. The raven is often central to the mythology of the Pacific Northwest Coast Native Americans, which depicts the bird as both creator and trickster.

    In Flight of the Ravens, the opening piano and chimes are meant to evoke feelings of beauty, majesty, and respect (creator). The first main theme and energetic tempo (beginning at measure 12, then 20), pays tribute to the Pacific Northwest Coast region in general. The second theme (measure 31), is what I refer to as the “Soaring Theme.” Setting this theme in 3/4 meter was intentional, evoking the feelings of flight and soaring high above the land.

    The quote heard in the Xylophone several times, is playful and quirky, portraying some of the trickster idea. Measures 62-89 definitely represent the trickster idea even more, with sounds in the upper WW’s also emulating raven calls. The clarinets contribute another trickster effect in measures 100 and 102. At the very end, you’ll see a text note in the Timpani and Percussion 1 part suggesting the use of large black umbrellas or jackets. These ideas are meant to imitate the look and sound of raven wings, starting slowly, gradually
    getting faster, then slowing again. Throughout my life, I have seen and heard ravens fly overhead many times, especially when spending time in the mountains, and the giant wingspan and loud “whoosh-whoosh” are imprinted in my mind.

    Finally, the main reason for writing about ravens in order to honor Professor Beth Bronk pertains to a specific story at TLU. One year, a family of ravens moved into the courtyard outside the TLU School of Music. They stayed around for a very long time, and faculty and students would recount various encounters, some of which involved the ravens scattering their branches and twigs or tapping on the windows late at night. While it is unknown if these particular birds will keep coming back year after year, they have made a lasting impact in the hearts and minds of
    the people who knew them.

    publisher: "Murphy Music Press",
    year: "2024",
    grade: "4",
    time: "6:20",
    details: `George Walker (1922 - 2018), a pioneering, Pulitzer Prize- winning figure in American classical music, left an indelible mark with his profound compositions and achievements. "Lyric for Strings" stands as a poignant testament to Walker's mastery of expression and emotional depth. Originally conceived as a movement within a larger string quartet during his undergraduate years at the Curtis Institute of Music, this piece underwent a transformative journey before emerging as a standalone work. 

    Originally titled "Lament," likely because of the composition's personal nature and homage to his grandmother, this tender piece was an extraction from a string quartet. Before its first professional performance,	Walker renamed the piece "Adagio;" however, he ultimately	settled on the evocative title "Lyric for Strings" before its publication.

    composer: "Laura Estes",
    publisher: "Excelcia Music Publishing",
    year: "2020",
    grade: "2",
    time: "2:26",
    details: `Who doesn’t have family members that love to complain or argue about something? In the Yiddish language, ‘kvetch’ means to complain, hence this piece was composed to playfully introduce young band students to several key concepts in the form of witty musical ‘complaints’ and ‘surprises’. From the	Trumpets’ initial childhood taunt of ‘Nana Nana Boo Boo’ to the percussion’s response of ‘Boo Boo Nana Nana’, every instrument section is in on the joke! Surprises include some one-note solos, a meter change to 6/8 and back, and a 3/4 measure out of nowhere. Complaints include ever-changing instrumental colors and groupings where everyone puts in their ‘two cents’ throughout the piece, culminating in an exciting eighth-note ‘Nana Nana’ final argument, after which all the instruments ‘make up’ in the last measure.

    Kvetchers is a mischievous musical argument in the form of a non-traditional concert march. Every section is featured in some fashion, and the percussionists will especially enjoy their role in the fun with two separate mallet parts, lots of ‘toys’, and a challenging snare part. Concepts to be introduced or reinforced for young players include part independence, use of chromatic versus diatonic notation in consecutive 4-note passages, Trombone glissandi, muted Trumpet, one easy time and meter change, trills, of-beats, shifting slurs, accidentals, and just a hint of 16th notes.

    Kvetchers (Surprises in Controversial Time) has a ‘little something special’ for every instrument in the band and is sure to please even the most ardent of kvetchers. Enjoy!

    title: "Evergreen",
    composer: "Viet Cuong",
    publisher: "Manuscript",
    grade: "5",
    time: "5:50",
    details: `From Viet Cuong:

    A few years ago, I wrote a piece called Deciduous, born from a period of loss following my father’s passing. His absence left a deep void, and for a time, my creativity struggled under the weight of that pain. He was the first close family member I had lost, and it felt natural, even inevitable, to dwell on all that was missing. But in the years since, as I have cycled through ups and downs of healing, certain constants in my life have helped me find strength and meaning again—especially the people closest to me and, of course, music.

    When I reflect on the journey through those difficult years, I find myself feeling more and more grateful for these enduring sources of support. Evergreen is a wistful yet exuberant tribute to these constants in our lives, the steadfast forces from which we draw love, energy, and resilience. In this sense, it serves as a companion piece—or perhaps a foil—to Deciduous. While loss may lead us to initially fixate on what is gone, remembering what remains—what has always been there, and what will continue to be—helps us move forward.

    Evergreen was commissioned by the Rouse High School Honor Band and their Director Ryan Johnstone for their 2024 Midwest Clinic Performance. Deepest thanks to all involved in this commission, and congratulations to Ryan Johnstone and the Rouse High School Honor Band for their invitation to Midwest.

    year: "2000",
    grade: "1",
    time: "3:07",
    conductor: "Cynthia A. Lansford",
    details: `The title for the piece is derived from Serengeti National Park, a wildlife refuge in northern Tanzania, East Africa. The park was established in 1951 and extends east and southeast from the shores of Lake Victoria. Serengeti has an area of about 14,763 sq km (5,700 sq mi). Its hills and grassland ranges provide habitat to elephants, black rhinoceroses, lions, leopards, cheetahs,

    gazelles, wildebeests, hyenas, buffalo, zebras, giraffes, and antelope. The park is the only place in Africa where vast animal migrations, especially in May and June, can still be seen.

    Susan Smith, the composer’s wife, also remarked “Robert was inspired by his research and work on Africa Ceremony and Song to create more multicultural  works for younger students to expose them to the music of the world and to expand percussion experiences. Robert had a knack for writing engaging pieces that encouraged and motivated students to stay engaged in music. 

    Our performance of “Serengeti Dreams” is in honor of Robert W. Smith for his profound and extensive contributions to band literature and music education.

    title: "Penny Lane",
    composer: "Paul McCartney & John Lennon/Chris Dedrick & Chris Coletti",
    publisher: "Canadian Brass Publications/Hal Leonard",
    year: "2024",
    grade: "3/5",
    time: "4:00",
    details: `"Penny Lane" is a song by the English rock band the Beatles that was released as a double A-side single with "Strawberry Fields Forever" in February 1967. It was written primarily by Paul McCartney and credited to the Lennon–McCartney songwriting partnership. The lyrics refer to Penny Lane, a street in Liverpool, and make mention of the sights and characters that McCartney recalled from his upbringing in the city.

    The Beatles began recording "Penny Lane" in December 1966, intending it as a song for their album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Instead, after it was issued as a single to satisfy record company demand for a new release, the band adhered to their policy of omitting previously released singles from their albums. The song features numerous modulations that occur mid-verse and between its choruses. Session musician David Mason played a piccolo trumpet solo for its bridge section.

    "Penny Lane" was a top-five hit across Europe and topped the US Billboard Hot 100. In Britain, it was the first Beatles single since "Please Please Me" in 1963 to fail to reach number 1 on the Record Retailer chart. In November 1967, "Penny Lane" was included on the US Magical Mystery Tour album. In 2021, Rolling Stone ranked the track at number 280 on its list of the "500 Greatest Songs of All Time". In 2006, Mojo ranked the song at number 9 of "The 101 Greatest Beatles Songs".

    In 2011, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

    The Canadian Brass' iconic rendition of Lennon & McCartney's “Penny Lane” has become a must-play arrangement for brass quintet featuring solo piccolo trumpet. This Chris Dedrick arrangement has now been further adapted by Chris Coletti for two solo trumpets and wind ensemble.

    title: "The Pines of Rome: IV. Pines of the Appian Way",
    composer: "Ottorino Respighi/Guy M. Duker",
    publisher: "Ricordi/Hal Leonard",
    year: "1974",
    grade: "6",
    time: "20:15 (5:15)",
    details: `The Pines of Rome is Respighi's most notable and durably popular composition, and this transcription for band by Guy Duker has long been considered a staple in the literature. With its specific musical imagery and brilliant scoring, this is truly a magnificent and rewarding work for mature bands.

    - Program note from publisher

    The final section of the Pines of Rome is titled Pines of the Appian Way. Respighi gives the following colorful description of an ancient Roman army on the march: “Misty Dawn on the Appian Way. Solitary pines stand guard over the tragic countryside. We hear the faint unceasing rhythm of numberless steps. A vision of ancient glories appears to the poet, trumpets blare and a consular army erupts in the brilliance of the newly risen sun — towards the Sacred Way, mounting to a triumph on the Capitoline Hill.” The movement opens quietly, with a slow and inexorable march, but builds gradually towards an enormous brassy peak (with several brassy knolls along the way...). To create this picture of Roman military might, Respighi’s score calls for six bucinae—Roman war trumpets. He also provides the helpful suggestion that modern trumpets may be used if bucinae are not available!
