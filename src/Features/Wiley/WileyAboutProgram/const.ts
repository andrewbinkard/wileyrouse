    programInfo: `The band program at Wiley Middle School serves more than 300 students, with seventh and eighth graders enrolled in one of three performing bands and sixth grade beginning band classes in a homogeneous setting. We are also fortunate to offer a chamber music course for our students.

Since the school opened in 2006, the Wiley bands have received Excellent and Superior ratings at the UIL Concert and Sightreading Evaluations. Students have been well-represented at Solo and Ensemble contests and participating numbers in the TMEA All-Region Band and Region Orchestra Auditions continue to rise on a yearly basis. The Wiley Wind Ensemble was invited and performed at the 2012 Western International Band Clinic (WIBC) under the direction of Garland Chaisson, the program’s inaugural director. The band has also been a National Winner in the Mark of Excellence Wind Band Honors Contest in 2010, 2014, 2022, and 2023. The Wiley Middle School Wind Ensemble was also named the 2023 TMEA CC Honor Band and performed at the TMEA convention in February of 2023. 

To improve their individual skills and musicianship, all students in the Wiley MS Band program attend weekly section rehearsals, and many students take advantage of the opportunity for private lessons through the LISD Private Lesson Program. In addition to their involvement in band activities, Wiley MS Band students are also active in other activities, including National Junior Honor Society, Student Council, Leadership, Theatre, Art, Choir, Athletics, Cheerleading, Dance Team, and many more. Through the dedicated work of many individuals, the Wiley Band program has built a tradition of success that has flourished within the school and in the community.`,
