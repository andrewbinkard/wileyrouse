    programName: "Rouse High School Bands",
    programInfo: `The band program at Rouse High School serves more than 220 ninth through twelfth-grade students, dispersed between 4 concert ensembles and our winter guard program.

The Rouse Honor Band is the premier concert ensemble within the Rouse High School Band program. Students are selected through a rigorous audition process each spring and fall. Currently, the band has students from grades nine through twelve. 

Quality recruitment, retention, and teaching within all levels of the vertical team has allowed for all ensembles within our program to flourish and improve rapidly over the past several years. 

Feeder schools within our vertical team include Stiles and Wiley Middle Schools. Both programs are very successful. Stiles performed at Midwest in 2015 and 2021. Some senior members of the 2020 ensemble that did not perform at Midwest due to the pandemic are on stage today! The Wiley Wind Ensemble performed at the TMEA Convention in 2023 after being named "Texas Honor Band" in class 2C the year prior. They are also an invited ensemble at this year’s Midwest Clinic!

Students in the Rouse Honor Band represent a diverse population within our school and are very high academic and artistic achievers. Last year's ensemble had 27 region band members from one of the most competitive TMEA regions in the state. Additionally, ten students represented Rouse as a member of the TMEA All-State Band. In the spring of 2023, the Rouse Honor Band entered the class 5A TMEA Honor Band Process and advanced through region, area, and state levels of competition, earning 4th place in finals.

All Rouse concert bands are consistently awarded “superior” ratings at UIL in both concert and sight reading/music literacy areas. Students hone their individual skills through daily rehearsals, weekly section rehearsals, with many students also participating in the Leander ISD Private Lesson Program.

As a program, our teaching philosophy is to grow each individual through our shared musical passion and journey. Key to our success is a constant awareness and drive to live up to the tenets of the The Rouse Band Way: 1) Demonstrate Character; 2) Come Prepared; 3) Participate with Enthusiasm; and 4) Support our Family.
