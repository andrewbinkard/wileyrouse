    details: `Uniting virtuosity and musical sensitivity, Caleb Hudson has carved out a unique space in the world of classical trumpet. A long-standing member of the esteemed Canadian Brass for over a decade, he has captivated international audiences. Caleb, a native of Lexington, Kentucky, earned both his Bachelor and Master of Music degrees from the Juilliard School. The New York Times has praised his artistry as "brilliantly stylish."

    In March 2024 Hudson releases his debut solo album “Nothing Less,” a testament to the art of ensemble-driven dialogue. Featuring a distinct blend of solo trumpet, violin, cello, flute, and clarinet, the music allows virtuosity and collaboration to intermingle seamlessly. The album introduces fresh compositions by Remy Le Boeuf, Kyle Athayde, and Caleb Hudson himself, while also offering innovative takes on classics by Corelli and Philip Glass.

    Caleb is acclaimed for his renditions of Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 2, which he performs on both the modern piccolo trumpet and the historical baroque trumpet. This expertise has enabled solo engagements with renowned ensembles such as the Philadelphia Orchestra, Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, Orchestra of St. Luke's, Trinity Baroque Orchestra, Handel and Haydn Society, and Philharmonia Baroque.

    Caleb co-founded "Triple Cortado," an innovative trio featuring Canadian Brass trombonist Achilles Liarmakopoulos and virtuosic pianist Ahmed Alom. This reimagined piano trio explores a diverse range of new compositions and arrangements, pushing the boundaries of brass chamber music.

    Beyond performance, Caleb is deeply committed to expanding the brass repertoire. A prolific arranger and composer, his works are often performed by Canadian Brass. His original composition, "White Rose Elegy," debuted at Lincoln Center, performed by the New York Philharmonic Principal Brass.

    Caleb's contributions also extend to educational literature; he was the recording artist for the groundbreaking Suzuki Trumpet School, Volume I. He credits his artistic growth to mentors such as Richard Byrd, Vincent DiMartino, Ken Larson, Raymond Mase, Mark Gould, and John Thiessen.

    Currently, Caleb serves as the Associate Professor of Trumpet at the Butler School of Music at the University of Texas at Austin. He has previously taught at the University of North Texas and Colorado State University, where his students have achieved professional success in both academic and performance realms. Deeply grateful for the opportunities and insights his musical journey has provided, Caleb is committed to nurturing the next generation of musicians.
